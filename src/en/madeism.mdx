short_description: "Monotheistic religion"
---

**Madeism** is a [monotheistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism) religion that professes faith
in the divinity of the person of [Made](Made), who is the Goddess creator of the universe and manifested 
her deity through the prophets of the [Books of Setsuwa](Books_of_Setsuwa). Currently considered the 
largest religion in the world, as a result of the fall of [Dorenism](Dorenism), composing more than half 
of the world's population and being the majority religion in [Waydines](Waydines) and in the [Ryūsei Shogunate](Ryūsei_Shogunate).

# History
Madeism originated unexpectedly during a competitive event among the community that was part of the [EDG SMP](EDG_SMP). 
Initially a phenomenon of fandom and humor, devotion to the figure of Made began to gain strength 
among the participants. What started as a joke soon evolved into a deeper cultural identity, especially 
with the rise of Waydinean nationalism in the Second Republic of Waydines.

However, Madeism as it exists today was born only at the beginning of the Third Republic, when there 
was a growing entry of Dorenist Church members into the servers. Dorenism was a previous religion, 
highly organized, whose ecclesiastical structure was considered an element of [Osmarian](Osmaria) 
cultural prestige. This organization caught the attention not only of Madeists but also of [Divinists](Divinism), 
who decided to reform their religions to make them more structured and institutionalized.

Thus, Madeism adopted a [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism) structure, 
established the subdistrict of [Kibosaki](Kibosaki) as its religious center, and formed presbyteries
and temples. The central [synod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod), the highest seat of Madeism, 
was created to legislate on doctrines, culminating in the institution of the _Church of Renewed Faith in Made_.

# Structure

The Church of Renewed Faith in Made currently has an organized hierarchy as follows:

**Pastors:** Responsible for temples and religious services. They are the ones who elect the presbyters of their region.

**Presbyters:** Form the presbytery and ensure adherence to the Confession of Faith. Only they can serve in cathedrals and basilicas.

**Synod of Kibosaki:** The supreme body, bringing together all presbyters to define religious legislation and possible doctrinal changes.

# Practices and Liturgies
## Communion
The practice of eating rice during Madeist services dates back to the arduous journey of the Madeists 
of the Han tribe to the Promised Land. Rice, as the grain that blessed Made in the waters of the golden 
river, carries a profound symbolism of spiritual renewal and connection with the Goddess.

> This grain, nurtured by the waters of my golden river, now carries my eternal blessing.

_&mdash; `Engen; Canto X, Verse 32`_

Rice is consumed in communion during services, as a symbol of unity and dedication to the faith, 
reflecting the guarantee of fulfillment of promises between the Goddess and the faithful.

## Midnight Festival
The Midnight Festival is a sacred event, inspired by the accounts in the Book of Engen, where the first 
Madeists would observe the full moon as a special moment of divine revelation. During this event, the 
faithful offer worship, perform offerings, and participate in purification rituals with light and fire, 
symbols of the Goddess.

With the reforms under the Covenant Kibo, the practice of holocausts was abolished, being replaced by 
an act of charity: offering food to the needy, established in the Covenant of Keito. Today, the festival 
is a moment of celebration and reflection, with a renewed emphasis on the spirit of communion and care 
for others, according to the Covenants and the practice of offering blessed rice from the Covenant of Han.

## Lunar Calendar
Madeism follows a lunar calendar, which is fundamental to the organization of festivities and religious 
rituals, such as the Midnight Festival. The observation of the Moon's phases guides the dates of 
celebrations and is central to the spirituality of the faithful, as it reflects the natural cycles of 
life and renewal.

# Scriptures
The **Books of Setsuwa** form the sacred canon of Madeism and are considered the divine revelations 
transmitted by the Goddess, through prophets and scribes. These scriptures cover teachings about love, 
faith, worship of the Goddess, and laws that guide the lives of the faithful. Each book has a unique 
structure, with chapters and verses, allowing for both public and personal reading.
