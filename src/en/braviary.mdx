**Braviary** is a [bald eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_eagle) (_Haliaeetus
leucocephalus_) and the most loyal companion of José Arcadio Morales ([Yharo](Yharo)). Known for his
intelligence and strength, Braviary is often seen soaring through the skies, executing precise
aerial maneuvers at his owner’s command. More than just a pet, Braviary serves as a scout and
guardian, proving his usefulness in both daily life and combat situations.

# Etymology

Braviary, like the other animals tamed by Yharo, is named after a Pokémon that shares
characteristics with its species. The name originates from
[Braviary](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Braviary_(Pokémon)>), a Pokémon known for its
bravery and strong bond with its trainer, much like Yharo's eagle.

# Notable Facts

-   Braviary is the first and only non-human to obtain an identification card in Waydines. His
    acceptance led to stricter citizenship requirements, preventing future animals from obtaining
    similar status.
-   Braviary has defended and saved Yharo on multiple occasions, using his keen eyesight, speed, and
    powerful talons to intervene in dangerous situations.
-   Aside from combat, Braviary is trained in executing complex aerial tricks, showcasing remarkable
    agility and intelligence.
-   Among Yharo’s many domesticated animals, Braviary was the fifth to be tamed and trained.
